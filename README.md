# hello-world
This is a short description about myself.
I am currently working towards becoming a data scientist.
I have learnt python2, and no learning python3 to go over what I have learnt.
I have started using python libraries that relate to data science, such as numpy, pandas and scipy.
I have also learnt SQL - Queries, Aggregate Functions, Multiple Tables, User churn and Marketing Attribution
I have also learnt a bit about hypothesis testing, and am very interested in learning more about statistics.
Majority of my learnings are through codecademy and attending meetups.
